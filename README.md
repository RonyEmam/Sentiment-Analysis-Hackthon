#### I wouldn't do this project without the help of these references. As a master student in computer science all my references are legit sources, and I didn't change my critical thinking/writing approach. In the next section you will find many IEEE journals, books, and trustworthy websites and I have citied them using IEEE citation. 

**Finally, Iâ€™d love to hear if this helps you with your day to day work and your thoughts on improvements.**
